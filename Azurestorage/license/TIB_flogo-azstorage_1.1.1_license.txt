Customer must duplicate unaltered copies of all proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Protected Materials. Except as stated in the Agreement, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's Marks.

	5.	Confidentiality. 
		a) Neither party shall disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the disclosing party's prior consent. Confidential Information may only be disclosed to individuals that need to know such information, and on the condition that the individual is subject to a written agreement to protect information with terms as protective as this Agreement. For the purposes of this section, the definition of Licensor and Customer includes Affiliates of either party. Licensor may use data collected during the Term in an aggregated, anonymized form, provided that such data is aggregated from more than one customer and does not identify Customer, Customer employees, or Customers' customers.
		b) The duty to protect Confidential Information does not apply to information that is shown to be: 
			i. available to the public other than by a breach of a confidentiality obligation; 
			ii. rightfully received from a third party not in breach of a confidentiality obligation; 
			iii. independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential Information of the other;
			iv. known to the recipient at the time of disclosure (other than under a separate confidentiality obligation); 
			v. produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party is given reasonable advance notice of the obligation to produce Confidential Information (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party's cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure. 
		c) Each party shall indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from a breach of this Section. Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. If either party breaches the confidentiality obligations, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. 
		d) Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party; except for rights explicitly granted in the Agreement, the receiving party does not acquire any rights to such Confidential Information.

	6.	Data Protection and Back-up.  
		a) If Customer exposes Licensor to an individual's Protected Data, Licensor will process and store such information pursuant to Licensor's Security Policies, Practices and Processes found at https://terms.tibco.com/posts/2301934-tibco-security-guidelines. If the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (GDPR) applies to Protected Data that Licensor processes on behalf of Customer as a data processor, then the Licensor's Data Processing terms at https://terms.tibco.com/posts/3309971-tibco-data-processing-agreement apply to such Protected Data. 
		b) Except when Licensor stores Customer data in connection with the delivery of a Cloud Service, Customer is responsible for backing-up its data and under no circumstances is Licensor responsible for the protection, loss, destruction, or maintenance of Customer's data.

	7.	Indemnity.
		a) Licensor shall, at its own expense, defend or at its option, settle, any claim or action brought against Customer to the extent it is based on a claim that the Software, or Materials, all as updated by Licensor and used in accordance with the Agreement, infringes any patent, copyright, or any trade secret of a third party. Furthermore, Licensor will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against damages, costs, and fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable exclusively to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment. Licensor's obligations to defend, settle, or indemnify Customer are subject to (i) Customer promptly notifying Licensor in writing of such claim; (ii) Licensor having the exclusive right to control such defense and/or settlement; and (iii) Customer providing reasonable assistance (at Licensor's expense) in the defense thereof. Customer shall not settle any claim, action or proceeding without Licensor's
prior written approval.
		b) Licensor shall not defend, INdemnify, or hold customer harmless for any claim IF: (a) CUSTOMER MADE modifications to the Software OR Materials or portions thereof; (b) such claim would have been avoided by use of the then current release of the Software made available to Customer; (c) Customer continued ITS allegedly infringing activity after being provided with modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement; or (d) such claim is BASED ON Customer's Output.
        c) IF LICENSOR Defends or settles an infringement claim arising under section 7.a above, Licensor's liability and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy (IN ADDITION TO THE "INDEMNITY") shall be for Licensor at its own expense, to either (a) repair, replace or modify the affected Software or re-perform the affected Consulting Services or (b) alternatively, procure for Customer the right to continue to use the affected Software or Materials.  If the foregoing remedies are not commercially feasible (in the reasonable opinion of Licensor), Licensor may (i) cancel the applicable Order form and, as applicable, for the AFFECTED Software refund the license fees and any unearned maintenance fees paid to Licensor by Customer for the affected Software, or (ii) for Consulting Services refund all amounts paid to Licensor by Customer for the affected Consulting Services.

	8.	Warranties.
		a) Licensor warrants that for 90 days following the Delivery Date ("Warranty Period"), the Software, as updated and used in accordance with the Documentation, will operate in all material respects in conformity with the functional specifications described in the Documentation.

			v. Customer deviating from the Licensor Software operating procedures described in the Documentation; or 
			vi. Errors caused by customizations. 
			Consulting services to correct defects or issues subject to one of the above warranty exclusions may be procured by Licensee under a Work Order pursuant to Licensor's standard time and material charges.
		c) If the Licensor Software does not perform as warranted during the Warranty Period, Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Errors. Customer shall promptly notify Licensor in writing of its claim within the Software Warranty Period.  Provided that such claim is determined by Licensor to be Licensor's responsibility, as Customer's exclusive remedy for any warranty claim, Licensor shall, within 30 days of its receipt of Customer's written notice, (i) correct such Error; (ii) provide Customer with a plan reasonably acceptable to Customer for correcting the Error, or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be accomplished with reasonable commercial efforts from Licensor, then Licensor may terminate the affected Licensor Software license and issue Customer a refund of the license fees paid for the affected Licensor Software. The preceding warranty cure constitutes Licensor's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedy for Licensor's breach of the warranty stated herein. 
		d) EXCEPT AS STATED ABOVE, LICENSOR, ITS LICENSORS, WEBHOST, DATACENTER AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING (i) ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY SOFTWARE, MATERIALS OR SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE, ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED OR WILL COMPLY WITH ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION (ii) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND (iii) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.

CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE and OTHER PRODUCTS or SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER TO
ACHIEVE CUSTOMER'S INTENDED RESULTS. Except for the excluded matters, in no event shall either party's total liability to the other for all claims arising out of or as a result of the AGREEMENT exceed the greater of 1,000,000 USD or the fees paid by Customer to Licensor under the applicable Order Form.

		b) The non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party's rights under this Agreement.
		c) This Agreement does not create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other.
		d) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, contractor, consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the other party.
		e) Licensor may designate any agent or subcontractor to perform such tasks and functions to complete any services covered under this Agreement, provided, however, that Licensor shall remain responsible for performance of its duties under the terms of this Agreement.
		f) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of an Order Form, Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, may audit Customer‘s compliance with this Agreement upon 10 days' notice and at reasonable times and report any results to Licensor's licensors. Customer shall, at no cost to Licensor, (i) provide any assistance reasonably requested by Licensor or its designee in conducting any such audit, including installing and operating audit software, (ii) make requested personnel, records, and information available to Licensor or its designee, and (iii) provide such assistance, personnel, records, systems access, and information to facilitate the timely completion of such audit. Customer's failure to comply with the provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If the audit reveals any noncompliance, Customer shall reimburse Licensor for the reasonable costs and expenses of the audit (including but not limited to
reasonable attorneys' fees), and Customer shall promptly cure any such noncompliance; provided, however, that the obligations under this section do not constitute a waiver of Licensor's termination rights and do not affect Licensor's right to payment for Software or Materials related to usage in excess of the Number of Units.
        g) Upon reasonable written notice of at least 3 months and not more than once per year, Customer may (1) audit Licensor's systems, processes, or facilities to determine compliance with this Agreement, (2) or request Licensor's assistance to provide or update information processed by Licensor on behalf of Customer, provided that (i) Customer pays a minimum fee of $50,000.00 for an engagement that may last up to 2 days (and $25,000 for each additional day thereafter), (ii) the audit takes place in an onsite or virtual audit environment performed on Licensor's hardware (i.e., a Licensor controlled computer) and the Customer's personnel (including auditors) are accompanied and/or supervised by TIBCO's representative at all times, (iii) soft or hard copies of data displayed during the audit will not be sent electronically or otherwise transported away from Licensor facility, and (iv) certain highly sensitive data such as Licensor customer information, Licensor employee personal data, and information
regarding Licensor's vulnerability is held in strict confidence and must not be shared with any individual that does not need to know such information.
        h) A waiver by a party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of continuing or succeeding breach.
        i) Performance under the Agreement will be postponed automatically if a party is prevented from performing by any act of or failure to act by the other party.  No delay or default in performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations) will constitute a breach of the Agreement if caused by force majeure or any other cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, fires, strikes, accidents, governmental action or regulatory changes, or acts of God.
		j) Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to an Affiliate, neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld.  Any such attempted assignment is void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of the Agreement, in whole or part, and requires Licensor's prior written consent.
		k) If Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event after an Order Form Effective Date, those users, divisions, or entities that were added to or divested from Customer's organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate Event are not authorized to use the Software or Materials until those users, divisions, or entities are added to this Agreement by way of a written amendment signed by duly authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer, or in the case of a divesture, the divested entity.
		l) This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and does not confer any rights or benefits on any third party, including any employee of a party, any client of a party, or any employee of a client of a party. Notwithstanding the above, the parties acknowledge that all rights and benefits afforded to Licensor under this Agreement apply equally to the owner of any Third Party Software, and such third party is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
		m) If Customer is entering into the Agreement from a European Union member country, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then the Agreement is governed by the laws of Ireland and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland.  Otherwise, the Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.
		n) If any sentence, clause, or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions are not affected or impaired. The parties shall interpret the affected provision in a manner that renders it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision.
		o) If any terms and conditions of the Master Terms conflict with the Documentation, then such license requirements or notices pertaining to Third Party Software included with the Software will control. Any conflict between the terms of the Agreement will be resolved in the following order for precedence: (i) Order Form; (ii) Exhibits, (iii) Master Terms.
        p) The Agreement constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, agreements, or understandings between the parties relating to its subject matter. No modification to the Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by each party, except in the case of an Order Form where Licensor's acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on Licensor's initial delivery of products or services under the Order Form. All pre-printed or standard terms of any Customer purchase order or other business processing document shall have no effect.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
